Long Short-Term Memory is an improved version of recurrent neural network designed by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber. LSTM is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks and excels in capturing long-term dependencies. Its applications extend to tasks involving time series and sequences. LSTMâ€™s strength lies in its ability to grasp the order dependence crucial for solving intricate problems, such as machine translation and speech recognition. The article provides an in-depth introduction to LSTM, covering the LSTM model, architecture, working principles, and the critical role they play in various applications.
